This is the example Provider. This has everything to make SuperBot2 an IRC bot.
Providers have the following layout

provider name/plugins/ 
provider name/services/
provider name/Connector.py
provider name/configFiles.cfg
    Right now an "AutoLoad.cfg" with 
    [Plugin]
        names=MyPlugin  MyOtherPlugin
    will cause superbot to auto load any plugins you want

Example configs are provided, rename them to use.
